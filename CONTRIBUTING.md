## setup.sql comments:

* Attribute names across the tables have an inconsistent capitalisation of the first letter.
* Should the manager tables have "ON DELETE RESTRICT"?
* courierID nerede ProdManagerContactsCourier'da?
* also i feel like there should be a lot more "ON DELETE CASCADES" than there are? idk
